title: Day1 Start my C sharp learning journey

This is my first day of self-learning C#. 

Although I had learned this programming language in the past when I was still a student in collega, I am not familiar with using C# to build up a actual project!

My target is to become a back-end programmer or a full-stack programmer,
so I am going to create a web project by using C# for back-end development and using React.js for frontend. 

Before starting, I asked chatGPT for some suggestions.

1. **Learn the Basics of C#:**
    
    - Familiarize yourself with the basic syntax, data types, control structures (if statements, loops), and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.
    - There are many online resources for learning C#. You can use platforms like Codecademy, Udemy, or free resources like Microsoft's official documentation and tutorials.
2. **Understand Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
    
    - Learn about classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. These are fundamental concepts in C# and OOP in general.
3. **Explore C# Advanced Concepts:**
    
    - Dive deeper into advanced C# features such as LINQ (Language Integrated Query), asynchronous programming with async/await, and generics.
4. **Build Console Applications:**
    
    - Practice your C# skills by building simple console applications. This will help you understand how to structure your code and solve problems using C#.
5. **Learn about .NET Framework and .NET Core:**
    
    - C# is often used with the .NET framework. Understand the basics of .NET and the newer .NET Core. .NET Core is now the recommended platform for new projects.
6. **Introduction to Web Development:**
    
    - Familiarize yourself with basic web development concepts. Understand HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Since you'll be using React.js, focus on building a strong foundation in JavaScript.
7. **Learn React.js:**
    
    - Start with the official React.js documentation. There are also many online courses and tutorials available on platforms like freeCodeCamp, Codecademy, and Udemy.
8. **Build Simple React Applications:**
    
    - Create simple React applications to practice your skills. Understand components, state, props, and the React lifecycle.
9. **Connect React with a Backend:**
    
    - Learn how to connect your React frontend with a backend built in C#. This involves making HTTP requests from your React application to the C# backend.
10. **Understand RESTful APIs:**
    
    - Learn about designing and implementing RESTful APIs using C# and ASP.NET Core. This will be crucial for communication between your frontend and backend.
11. **Database Integration:**
    
    - Explore database integration with C#. Understand how to use technologies like Entity Framework Core to interact with databases.
12. **Build Full-Stack Projects:**
    
    - Once you're comfortable with both C# and React, start building full-stack projects. This will help you apply your knowledge and gain practical experience.
13. **Continuous Learning:**
    
    - Stay updated with the latest developments in C# and React.js. Follow blogs, participate in forums, and explore advanced topics as your skills progress.

So, let us start with a small "Hello world" console app project for a warm up first.

Open Visual Studio > Create new project > Console app

Boom!! We created a project.

Let's type some simple code on it.

Just simply put my name and the current datetime on it.

Run.
