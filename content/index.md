These are my personal notes as I start my self-learning journey to use C# for building modern web applications. This is a adventure into uncharted territory for me, and I am desire to dive into the world of developing real projects. 

I believe this experience will provide valuable insights into how companies build and deploy applications. Excited to start this learning adventure and I am looking forward to gain the knowledge and skills step by step.

Enjoy.
